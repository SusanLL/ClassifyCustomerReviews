1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate two neural network models, a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to classify customer reviews into star ratings. These models leverage different architectural paradigms to process and analyze textual data:

FFNN: Processes text reviews as fixed-length vector representations, making it a straightforward yet powerful approach for classification tasks.
RNN: Utilizes sequential processing to capture dependencies between words in a review, offering a deeper understanding of temporal relationships within the data.
The dataset contains customer reviews labeled with star ratings. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The primary objective is to train these models on the dataset, evaluate their classification performance, and compare their strengths and limitations.

Setup Instructions:

1. Access the Code
Click the document FFNN.ipynb and RNN.ipynb

2. Run the Code
Once you've opened the Colab notebook, simply run each cell to execute the analysis. This will build the models, perform the analysis, and display results such as performance metrics and visualizations.
